Usually when settlements develop to a certain scale, Israel will declare them legal. Early detection can help the international community intervene earlier.

Users can select point options and a specific year to obtain the target position for that year. We also provide quantitative statistics and line charts to help users understand their changing trends.\nAdditionally, users can select other options such as West Bank borders, Palestinian-controlled areas, Israeli-controlled areas, etc. We also provide layers of some analysis processes to help users better understand the working principle of the application. Users can freely view these layers, such as SAVI analysis results, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):\nMap.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);\n\nMap.setOptions(\"satellite\");\n\nvar aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);\nYou can include images:\n\n\n\nPixelwise T-Test, 2018\n\n\nand math: \\[ \\Large t = {\\frac{\\overline{x_1}-\\overline{x_2}} {\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \\frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} \\]"
