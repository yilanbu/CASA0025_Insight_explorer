# Initial Project

## Project Summary 

In the West Bank of the Jordan River, Israel continues to encroach on Palestinian land by establishing illegal outposts, transforming them into settlements, and eventually legalizing them. The objective of this application is to detect these outposts and early settlements. Many journalists and researchers hope to mitigate the situation of Palestinian victimization through early intervention and raise public awareness about the status of Palestine beyond Gaza. However, they often manually search for these targets on satellite images. We hope to help them quickly locate these targets through this application.

This application initially uses the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to identify target land types, then employs change detection to identify newly cultivated land plots that appear each year. These plots include changes in desert areas and minor agricultural land developments. Therefore, it is necessary to use graphic filtering to select plots of specific areas and shapes, and subsequently pinpoint their central locations. Finally, we attempt to distinguish whether these plots belong to Israel through machine learning.

### Problem Statement 

The aim of this application is to use satellite imagery to find and mark all Israeli outposts and emerging settlements within the West Bank. For target users, they can quickly query the location and number of these newly emerged territorial encroachments.

### End User 

Journalists, researchers and international organizations. 

Israeli settlements are illegal. Usually when settlements develop to a certain scale, Israel will declare them legal. Early detection can help the international community intervene earlier. Some reporters did a manual blanket search through Google Earth. We hope this helps them resolve the issue quickly.

### Data

Harmonized Sentinel-2 MSI: MultiSpectral Instrument, Level-2A.

### Methodology

- Land Cover Classification(Random Forest), Feature Selection(NDVI, NDBI, SAVI) 
- Change detection
- Morphological Analysis, Area and Shape Filtering
- Classification(Support Vector Machine, Random Forest)

### Interface

The main function is to provide relevant points to help users quickly locate the latest settlements or outposts. Users can select point options and a specific year to obtain the target position for that year. We also provide quantitative statistics and line charts to help users understand their changing trends.

Additionally, users can select other options such as West Bank borders, Palestinian-controlled areas, Israeli-controlled areas, etc. We also provide layers of some analysis processes to help users better understand the working principle of the application. Users can freely view these layers, such as SAVI analysis results, etc.

## How it Works 


```js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```

You can include images:

and math:
$$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$
